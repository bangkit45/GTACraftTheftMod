<p>They are the gangs in GTA San Andreas (and V)! GTA Street Wars Addon has brought some of the gangs into Minecraft Pocket Edition. They are all hostile, so it will happen a chaotic battle if they meet.<br />Have you played GTA before? This add-on promises to bring you interesting things.</p>
<h2><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Gangs</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The Grove Street</strong></h3>
<p>This gang (green) replace villagers. They will attack if another gang attack them, they are neutral by default.</p>
<p>It would be great if the Grove Street gang could be hired and be part of your gang. These are just an unrealistic feature, but in the future, this is a good idea to implement.</p>
